# Telemarketing in Call Centers

## Introduction

Call centers are specialized services for large-scale telephone communication. In a call center, the goal is to maximize the number of calls that result in successful contact with customers. The main challenges include:
- Strict regulations governing telemarketing in France.
- Restrictions on calling times and days.
- Adherence to do-not-call lists.

⇒ Main challenge: optimizing the reachability of prospects.

## Machine Learning Model

In this project, we developed a machine learning model capable of predicting the outcome of a call, specifically predicting the probability that a person will answer the call using a Bayesian network. This type of model is particularly well-suited for handling uncertainties and probabilistic relationships between different variables, allowing for robust and interpretable predictions.

## TODO 

-Test more column matching to get the best model
-Create the decision matrix

## Installation requirements

- To run the project, please place the `calls_a4.csv` file in the project directory.
- You can then run all the cells.
- If needed pls install the python modules (pyAgrum,Scikit-learn,pandas,numpy)

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
